# ToDoList App

This is a simple ToDoList web application where users can add, cross out, and delete tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery for enhanced interactivity.

## Features

- Add Task: Users can create new tasks by typing text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Cross Out Task: Tasks can be marked as completed with a double-click, which applies a strike-through style.
- Delete Task: Each task features a delete button ("X") that allows users to remove it from the list.
- Reorder Tasks: Users can reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them within the list.
